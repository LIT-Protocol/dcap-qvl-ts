      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup task into subtasks covering: 1) Initial repository setup with package.json and TypeScript configuration, 2) Development tooling setup (ESLint, Prettier, Jest), 3) Project structure creation with necessary directories, 4) CI/CD pipeline configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup procedures with moderate complexity due to the need to configure multiple tools and ensure they work together properly. The task is well-defined with clear steps, but requires attention to detail for proper configuration of TypeScript, testing frameworks, and linting tools."

      "reasoning": "This task requires deep understanding of Intel SGX/TDX data structures and careful translation from Rust to TypeScript. The complexity comes from ensuring type safety and maintaining parity with the original implementation. Multiple related but distinct data structures need to be implemented correctly."

      "reasoning": "Binary parsing is inherently complex and error-prone, requiring careful handling of byte offsets, endianness, and data validation. The task involves implementing parsers for multiple quote formats and versions, with strict correctness requirements. Thorough testing is essential to ensure robustness against malformed inputs."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the collateral fetching implementation into subtasks covering: 1) HTTP client implementation with timeout and retry logic, 2) PCCS endpoint integration for different collateral types, 3) Intel PCS endpoint integration, 4) Caching mechanism for collateral data, 5) Error handling and recovery strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves network communication with external services, requiring robust error handling, retry logic, and timeout management. The implementation needs to support multiple endpoints and collateral types, with proper caching to optimize performance. Security considerations for handling sensitive collateral data add to the complexity."

      "reasoning": "Cryptographic implementations require deep expertise and extreme attention to detail. This task involves implementing multiple cryptographic primitives and protocols, with potential security implications if implemented incorrectly. The complexity is high due to the need for correctness, security, and compatibility with existing standards."

      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it integrates all other components and implements the core security-critical verification logic. It requires deep understanding of Intel DCAP specifications and security protocols. The implementation must handle multiple verification steps, each with its own complexity, while maintaining security guarantees equivalent to the Rust implementation."
